# Analyzing-Employee-Performance-for-HR-Analytics-Using-Python-and-MySQL

# Project Description


This project will train you how to use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.

 # Pre-processing the dataset:
In this task you will be working on handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, data type transformation, removing duplicates and data validations. Once you have completed this task, you will get a refined and a cleaner data set for further analysis.

Steps to perform Data Pre-processing: 

Step 1: Removing duplicate rows 
Step 2: Removing rows for which numeric columns are having irrelevant data type values
Step 3: Remove irrelevant values from each column if any. Validation of all values for a column
        Check for any inconsistencies or discrepancies in data types, units, or formats.
        Feel free to add more validation checks which you might feel necessary for the datasetâ€™s integrity
Step 4: Export the cleaned dataset as a .csv file: prefer UTF-8 encoding.
Step 5: Convert the pre-processed dataset into an SQL file. 
Step 6: Manually generate a table by utilizing the database information provided in the "Database Info" tab.

table cantains:
Table Name: employee
Table Columns: `employee_id`, `department`, `region`, `education`, `gender`, `recruitment_channel`, `no_of_trainings`,  `age`, `previous_year_rating`, `length_of_service`, `KPIs_met_more_than_80`, `awards_won`, `avg_training_score`
